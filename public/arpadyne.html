    <h1>Welcome to ARPADYNE!</h1>
    <p>
      The original Internet was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>. It was designed to be decentralized from the very beginning. Rather than using DNS (centralized domain name lookup systems), each node had its own HOST file that mapped domains to IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all of the security, privacy, and net neutrality concerns of the centralized web, net citizens are initiating discussions about going back to a decentralized web.
      ARPADYNE is the beginning of this movement. It has no DNS and no web servers. Every node on the network is a peer!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARPADYNE leverages <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> as the new Internet's P2P file system and <a href="https://computes.com">Computes</a> as its decentralized and distributed computing platform. We are introducing a new TLD known as <b>".a"</b> to indicate that links are ARPADYNE links; however, any TLD is supported!
    </p>
